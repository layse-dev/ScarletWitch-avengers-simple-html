                    <b>Wanda Maximoff</b>, also known as the <b>Scarlet Witch</b>, is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro. Born with the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Wolfgang von Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying Wanda's powers. While her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic abilities. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Stark, but abandoned him when they discovered his true intentions to eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived, and shortly after relocated to the Avengers Compound in the United States of America.
                    <br><br>
                    During the Avengers Civil War, she sided with Captain America and was briefly imprisoned on the Raft before Rogers freed her alongside his teammates. Over the next two years, Maximoff reunited and reconciled with Vision, and together the two started living off the grid in Europe, forming a romantic relationship. However, the two soon came under threat from Thanos and the Black Order, who sought the Mind Stone. After being ambushed by the Black Order, they sought refuge in Wakanda with the remaining Avengers. Maximoff took part in the city's defense when the Black Order invaded the city, and died in the Snap after Thanos completed the Infinity Gauntlet. After the victims of the Snap were resurrected in 2023, Maximoff was among the many heroes who fought during the Battle of Earth, defeating Thanos and his armies.
                    <br><br>
                    Soon after, Maximoff became overwhelmed by immense grief from her recent personal losses, unwittingly unleashing her Chaos Magic powers to create an alternate idyllic paradise of classical sitcom tropes within the town of Westview. She enthralled its inhabitants as cast members and cut the town off from the outside world through an energy field. With a recreated Vision as her husband, Maximoff lived her ideal life, even producing twin sons, Tommy and Billy. Further complicating the crisis was Agatha Harkness, a fellow witch who sought to understand the nature of Maximoff's new reality, and S.W.O.R.D., an organization led by Tyler Hayward who wished to eliminate her. After defeating Harkness and the S.W.O.R.D. agents, Maximoff dispelled her reality, erasing her family in the process. Realizing the amount of damage she had done to Westview, Maximoff fled into isolation and began studying the Darkhold.
